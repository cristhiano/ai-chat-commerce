# Project Constitution

**Project:** B2C Chat Application  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Ratified:** 2024-12-19  
**Last Amended:** 2024-12-19

## Preamble

This constitution establishes the fundamental principles and governance framework for B2C Chat Application. These principles serve as non-negotiable standards that guide all development decisions, architectural choices, and quality assurance processes.

## Core Principles

### Code Quality

**Principle:** All code MUST maintain high standards of readability, maintainability, and consistency.

**Requirements:**
- Code MUST follow established style guides and formatting standards
- Functions and classes MUST be single-purpose with clear, descriptive names
- Complex logic MUST be documented with inline comments explaining business rationale
- Code reviews MUST be mandatory for all changes before merging
- Technical debt MUST be tracked and addressed within defined timeframes
- Code duplication MUST be eliminated through proper abstraction and refactoring

**Rationale:** High-quality code reduces bugs, improves maintainability, and accelerates development velocity while reducing long-term costs.

### Testing Standards

**Principle:** Comprehensive testing MUST ensure system reliability and prevent regressions.

**Requirements:**
- Unit tests MUST achieve minimum 80% code coverage for all business logic
- Integration tests MUST validate critical user workflows and API contracts
- End-to-end tests MUST cover primary user journeys
- All tests MUST be deterministic and not depend on external state
- Test failures MUST block deployment until resolved
- Performance tests MUST validate response time and throughput requirements
- Security tests MUST be included in the test suite for authentication and authorization flows

**Rationale:** Robust testing prevents production failures, enables confident refactoring, and ensures system reliability under various conditions.

### User Experience Consistency

**Principle:** User interfaces MUST provide consistent, intuitive, and accessible experiences across all touchpoints.

**Requirements:**
- Design systems MUST be established and enforced across all user interfaces
- User interactions MUST follow established patterns and conventions
- Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) MUST be met for all user-facing features
- Error messages MUST be clear, actionable, and consistent in tone
- Loading states and feedback MUST be provided for all asynchronous operations
- Responsive design MUST work seamlessly across all supported device sizes
- Internationalization MUST be supported for all user-facing text

**Rationale:** Consistent user experience reduces cognitive load, improves usability, and builds user trust and satisfaction.

### Performance Requirements

**Principle:** System performance MUST meet defined benchmarks and scale efficiently with user growth.

**Requirements:**
- Page load times MUST not exceed 3 seconds on standard broadband connections
- API response times MUST be under 200ms for 95% of requests
- Database queries MUST be optimized and indexed appropriately
- Frontend assets MUST be minified, compressed, and cached effectively
- Memory usage MUST be monitored and optimized to prevent leaks
- Performance budgets MUST be established and enforced for bundle sizes
- Critical rendering path MUST be optimized for above-the-fold content

**Rationale:** Performance directly impacts user satisfaction, conversion rates, and operational costs while ensuring scalability.

## Governance

### Amendment Procedure

Constitutional amendments require:
1. Proposal submission with clear rationale and impact analysis
2. Review period of minimum 7 days for stakeholder feedback
3. Approval by project maintainers (minimum 2/3 majority)
4. Version increment according to semantic versioning rules
5. Update of all dependent templates and documentation

### Versioning Policy

- **MAJOR (X.0.0):** Backward incompatible changes to principles or governance
- **MINOR (X.Y.0):** Addition of new principles or significant expansion of existing guidance
- **PATCH (X.Y.Z):** Clarifications, wording improvements, or non-semantic refinements

### Compliance Review

- Quarterly reviews of principle adherence and effectiveness
- Annual assessment of principle relevance and potential updates
- Continuous monitoring through automated tooling where applicable
- Regular team training on constitutional requirements

### Enforcement

Violations of constitutional principles MUST be addressed through:
1. Immediate remediation when possible
2. Documentation of technical debt when immediate fix is not feasible
3. Escalation to project maintainers for persistent violations
4. Regular compliance audits and reporting
