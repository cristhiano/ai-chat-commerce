[USER_INPUT_TEXT]
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Constitutional Alignment

All specifications MUST comply with these constitutional principles:

### Code Quality Standards
- Specifications MUST define clear, maintainable code requirements
- Single-purpose functions and classes MUST be specified
- Code review processes MUST be included
- Technical debt management MUST be addressed

### Testing Standards Requirements
- Comprehensive testing approach MUST be defined
- Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing MUST be specified
- Performance and security testing MUST be included
- Test coverage requirements MUST be established

### User Experience Consistency Requirements
- Design system compliance MUST be specified
- Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) MUST be enforced
- User interaction patterns MUST be consistent
- Error handling and feedback MUST be defined

### Performance Requirements
- Response time targets MUST be specified
- Throughput requirements MUST be defined
- Optimization strategies MUST be planned
- Monitoring and alerting MUST be included

## Specification Generation Process

1. **Requirement Analysis:** Parse user input for functional and non-functional requirements
2. **Constitutional Compliance:** Ensure all specification elements align with principles
3. **Technical Design:** Define architecture, components, and data flow
4. **Testing Strategy:** Specify comprehensive testing approach
5. **Performance Planning:** Define optimization and monitoring requirements
6. **Template Population:** Fill spec-template.md with concrete technical details
7. **Validation:** Verify completeness and constitutional adherence
8. **Output:** Generate final specification document

## Specification Structure

### Technical Requirements
- Functional requirements with clear acceptance criteria
- Non-functional requirements including performance, quality, and UX
- Architecture overview and component design
- API design and data flow specifications

### Implementation Plan
- Phased implementation approach
- Testing requirements for each phase
- Quality gates and review processes
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

### Testing Strategy
- Unit testing with coverage targets
- Integration testing for system validation
- End-to-end testing for user journeys
- Performance and security testing requirements

### Performance Considerations
- Optimization strategies and techniques
- Monitoring and alerting requirements
- Scalability planning and resource management
- Performance benchmarks and targets

## Quality Gates

All specifications MUST include:
- [ ] Code quality requirements defined
- [ ] Testing strategy comprehensive
- [ ] UX consistency requirements specified
- [ ] Performance targets established
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Accessibility requirements defined
- [ ] Risk assessment completed
- [ ] Implementation plan detailed

## Output Format

Generate specifications using the spec-template.md structure with:
- Concrete technical requirements replacing placeholders
- Constitutional principle compliance verified
- Clear implementation guidance
- Comprehensive testing approach
- Performance optimization strategies
- Risk mitigation plans

## Validation Checklist

Before finalizing any specification:
- [ ] All constitutional principles addressed
- [ ] Technical requirements clear and testable
- [ ] Testing approach comprehensive
- [ ] Performance considerations included
- [ ] UX consistency maintained
- [ ] Code quality standards enforced
- [ ] Security requirements defined
- [ ] Accessibility compliance specified
- [ ] Implementation plan realistic
- [ ] Risk mitigation strategies defined
