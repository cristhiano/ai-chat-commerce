## User Input

```text
[USER_INPUT_TEXT]
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Constitutional Alignment

All task management MUST comply with these constitutional principles:

### Code Quality Requirements
- Tasks MUST include code review and quality checks
- Technical debt management MUST be planned
- Code standards enforcement MUST be included
- Maintainability considerations MUST be addressed

### Testing Standards Requirements
- Testing tasks MUST be included for all deliverables
- Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing MUST be planned
- Performance and security testing MUST be scheduled
- Test coverage validation MUST be included

### User Experience Consistency Requirements
- UX tasks MUST follow established design patterns
- Accessibility testing MUST be included
- User research and validation MUST be planned
- Design system compliance MUST be verified

### Performance Requirements
- Performance validation MUST be included where applicable
- Optimization tasks MUST be planned
- Monitoring and alerting MUST be implemented
- Scalability testing MUST be conducted

## Task Generation Process

1. **Requirement Analysis:** Parse user input for project scope and deliverables
2. **Constitutional Compliance:** Ensure all tasks align with constitutional principles
3. **Task Breakdown:** Decompose work into manageable, testable units
4. **Quality Integration:** Include testing, review, and validation tasks
5. **Template Population:** Fill tasks-template.md with concrete task details
6. **Validation:** Verify completeness and constitutional adherence
7. **Output:** Generate final task management structure

## Task Categories

- [ ] Code quality tasks defined
- [ ] Testing tasks comprehensive
- [ ] UX consistency tasks specified
- [ ] Performance tasks included
- [ ] Quality gates established
- [ ] Review processes defined
- [ ] Acceptance criteria clear
- [ ] Dependencies mapped

## Output Format

Generate task management using the tasks-template.md structure with:
- Concrete task details replacing placeholders
- Constitutional principle compliance verified
- Clear acceptance criteria and quality gates
- Comprehensive testing and validation tasks
- Performance optimization and monitoring tasks
- Risk mitigation and escalation procedures

## Validation Checklist
