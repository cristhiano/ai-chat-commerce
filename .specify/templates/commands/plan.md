- Technical debt management MUST be addressed
- Code standards and formatting MUST be enforced
- Maintainability considerations MUST be included

### Testing Standards Requirements
- Comprehensive testing strategy MUST be defined
- Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing MUST be planned
- Performance and security testing MUST be included
- Test coverage targets MUST be specified

### User Experience Consistency Requirements
- Design system implementation MUST be planned
- Accessibility compliance MUST be addressed
- User research and testing MUST be included
- Responsive design considerations MUST be planned

### Performance Requirements
- Performance benchmarks MUST be established
- Optimization strategies MUST be planned
- Monitoring and alerting MUST be included
- Scalability considerations MUST be addressed

## Plan Generation Process

1. **Analyze Requirements:** Parse user input for project scope, objectives, and constraints
2. **Constitutional Compliance:** Ensure all plan elements align with constitutional principles
3. **Template Population:** Fill plan-template.md with concrete values based on analysis
4. **Validation:** Verify completeness and constitutional adherence
5. **Output:** Generate final plan document
