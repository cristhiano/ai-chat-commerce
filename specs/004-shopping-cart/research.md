# Research: Shopping Cart Page

## Overview

This document captures the research and decisions made during the planning phase for the Shopping Cart Page feature.

## Decisions Made

### 1. Cart State Management
**Decision:** Use existing CartContext (React Context API) for state management

**Rationale:**
- CartContext already implemented and tested
- Consistent with application architecture
- Provides centralized cart state management
- Supports both guest and authenticated users

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Redux (overkill for cart-only feature)
- Local component state (doesn't persist across pages)

### 2. Component Architecture
**Decision:** Build modular, single-purpose components (CartItem, CartSummary, CartActions, etc.)

**Rationale:**
- Follows React best practices
- Easy to test individual components
- Reusable across different cart views
- Maintainable and scalable

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Monolithic component (harder to test and maintain)
- Multiple small components per responsibility (too granular)

### 3. Optimistic UI Updates
**Decision:** Implement optimistic UI updates for quantity changes

**Rationale:**
- Better perceived performance
- Immediate user feedback
- Reduces perceived latency
- Industry best practice for e-commerce carts

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Wait for API response before updating UI (slower perceived performance)
- No optimistic updates (worse user experience)

### 4. Responsive Design Approach
**Decision:** Mobile-first responsive design with breakpoints

**Rationale:**
- Mobile shopping is dominant
- Progressive enhancement approach
- Consistent with application patterns
- Tailwind CSS already provides responsive utilities

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Desktop-first design (poor mobile experience)
- Separate mobile/desktop views (maintenance overhead)

### 5. Accessibility Implementation
**Decision:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with keyboard navigation and screen reader support

**Rationale:**
- Legal compliance requirement
- Inclusive design
- Better UX for all users
- Industry standard

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Minimum compliance (misses users)
- Over-engineering (unnecessary complexity)

## Technology Choices

### UI Framework
**Choice:** React 19+ with TypeScript

**Rationale:** Already in use, provides type safety, established patterns

### Styling
**Choice:** Tailwind CSS

**Rationale:** Consistent with application, responsive utilities, rapid development

### State Management
**Choice:** React Context API via CartContext

**Rationale:** Already implemented, sufficient for cart needs, less boilerplate

### Testing Framework
**Choice:** Jest + React Testing Library

**Rationale:** Standard for React apps, good component testing, already configured

## Architectural Patterns

### Component Pattern
- Functional components with hooks
- Props for parent-child communication
- Context for global state
- Custom hooks for reusable logic

### Data Flow Pattern
- Unidirectional data flow
- Parent passes data down
- Callbacks passed down for child-to-parent communication
- Context for cross-cutting concerns

### Error Handling Pattern
- Try-catch for async operations
- Error state in context
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful degradation

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
1. React.memo for CartItem to prevent unnecessary re-renders
2. Debounce quantity changes to reduce API calls
3. Optimistic UI updates for immediate feedback
4. Lazy load cart data only when needed
5. Virtual scrolling for large carts (future enhancement)

### Monitoring
- Page load time tracking
- API response time monitoring
- Error rate tracking
- User interaction analytics

## Security Considerations

### Client-Side
- Input validation for quantity constraints
- XSS prevention through React auto-escaping
- CSRF protection via session-based authentication

### Server-Side
- All validation server-side (trust but verify)
- Inventory checks prevent overselling
- SQL injection prevention through GORM

## Open Questions

None - all technical decisions made with sufficient context and research.
