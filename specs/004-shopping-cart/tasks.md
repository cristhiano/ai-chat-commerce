# Implementation Tasks: Shopping Cart Page

**Feature:** Shopping Cart Page  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** 2024-12-26  
**Technology Stack:** React 19+, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, CartContext API

## Overview

This document defines the implementation tasks for the Shopping Cart Page feature. Tasks are organized by user story phases to enable independent implementation and testing. All backend cart infrastructure already exists.

## User Stories

### US1: Display Shopping Cart (P1)
**Goal:** Users can view all items in their shopping cart with complete product details  
**Test Criteria:** Cart page displays all cart items with product name, SKU, quantity, prices, and totals within 2 seconds

### US2: Modify Cart Items (P1)
**Goal:** Users can modify cart contents (change quantities, remove items) with immediate visual feedback  
**Test Criteria:** Quantity updates respond within 500ms, remove operations complete with confirmation, all changes persist correctly

### US3: Navigate from Cart (P2)
**Goal:** Users can proceed to checkout or return to shopping with clear, intuitive navigation  
**Test Criteria:** Continue Shopping returns to catalog, Proceed to Checkout navigates to checkout page, both actions complete within 200ms

### US4: Polish & Optimize (P2)
**Goal:** Cart page provides smooth, accessible, and performant experience across all devices  
**Test Criteria:** Animations run at 60fps, WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verified, responsive design works on mobile/tablet/desktop

## Dependencies

**Story Completion Order:**
- US1 → US2 → US3 → US4 (sequential progression)
- Each story builds incrementally on previous functionality
- US1 must be complete before US2 (need to display items before modifying them)
- US2 must be complete before US3 (need full cart functionality before navigation)
- US4 polishes the experience built in US1-US3

## Implementation Strategy

**MVP Scope:** US1, US2 (Core Cart View and Modification)  
**Incremental Delivery:** Each user story is independently testable and deployable
