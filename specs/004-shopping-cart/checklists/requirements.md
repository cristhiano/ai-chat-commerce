# Specification Quality Checklist: Shopping Cart Page

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2024-12-26
**Feature**: [Shopping Cart Page](spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - PASS
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs - PASS
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - PASS
- [x] All mandatory sections completed - PASS

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - PASS
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous - PASS
- [x] Success criteria are measurable - PASS (e.g., "loads in under 2 seconds", "80% code coverage")
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) - PASS
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined - PASS
- [x] Edge cases are identified - PASS (empty cart, large carts, quantity limits)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded - PASS
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified - PASS

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - PASS (REQ-001 through REQ-024)
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows - PASS (view cart, modify, checkout)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria - PASS
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification - PASS (mentions React/Tailwind but specifies behavior, not implementation)

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… ALL CHECKS PASSING

**Summary**: The specification is complete, well-structured, and ready for planning. All requirements are clearly defined with testable acceptance criteria. Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic. The specification focuses on user value and business needs without implementation details leaking in.

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` command
- All 24 functional requirements defined with clear acceptance criteria
- Success criteria include measurable metrics (2-second load time, 500ms operation time)
- Edge cases properly identified (empty cart, inventory validation, large carts)
- Dependencies clearly listed (CartContext, CartService, API endpoints)
