**Test Criteria:** Users can log in with correct credentials and receive JWT token within 500ms

### US3: User Logout (P1)
**Goal:** Users can terminate their sessions securely  
**Test Criteria:** Users can log out and sessions are invalidated immediately

### US4: Password Reset (P2)
**Goal:** Users can reset forgotten passwords via email  
**Test Criteria:** Users receive reset link within 5 minutes and can change password

### US5: Password Update (P2)

## Implementation Notes

- **TDD Approach:** Test tasks can be added for comprehensive coverage
- **File Coordination:** Tasks affecting the same files must run sequentially
- **Dependency Management:** Each phase builds upon previous phases
- **Parallel Opportunities:** Tasks marked with [P] can run concurrently
- **Story Independence:** Each user story phase is independently testable

## Success Metrics

- **Response Time:** < 500ms for login queries
- **Throughput:** Support 1000+ concurrent authentication requests
- **Security:** 100% of brute force attempts blocked
- **Coverage:** 85%+ test coverage for authentication functionality
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
