# Technical Specification: User Authentication

## Constitution Check

This specification MUST comply with constitutional principles:

- **Testing Standards:** Comprehensive testing approach must be defined for all components
- **User Experience Consistency:** Technical implementation must support consistent UX patterns
- **Performance Requirements:** All technical solutions must meet performance benchmarks

## Specification Overview

**Feature/Component:** User Authentication  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Author:** AI Assistant  
**Date:** 2024-12-19  
**Status:** DRAFT

## Clarifications

### Session 2024-12-19

- Q: What account lifecycle and state management should the system support? → A: Three states: active (normal access), locked (temporarily after 5 failed login attempts for 15 minutes), and suspended (permanently after security breach or admin action)
- Q: How should the system handle concurrent login sessions from multiple devices? → A: Users can have active sessions on multiple devices simultaneously with each device maintaining its own independent session token
- Q: How long should password reset tokens remain valid? → A: 24 hours (provides reasonable user convenience while maintaining security)
- Q: Should new user accounts require email verification before activation? → A: No email verification required; accounts are active immediately after registration to reduce friction
- Q: What feedback should locked accounts receive when attempting to log in during lockout? → A: Specific lockout message indicating account is temporarily locked with time remaining until automatic unlock

## Problem Statement

### Current State
Users must be able to register accounts, log in securely, manage their authentication credentials, and maintain authenticated sessions to access personalized features and protected resources in the application.

### Pain Points

### Success Criteria
- Users can register new accounts with valid email and secure password
- Users can log in and maintain authenticated sessions

## Technical Design

### Architecture Overview
The authentication feature consists of:
- User registration interface for creating new accounts
- Login interface for establishing sessions
- Password management (reset, update)
- Session management and validation
- Security middleware for protected routes
- Password hashing and verification service
- Email verification service for password resets

### Component Design
- **Registration Component**: Validates input, creates user account, hashes password
- **Login Component**: Validates credentials, creates session, returns authentication token
- **Password Service**: Handles hashing, verification, and validation of passwords
- **Session Manager**: Creates, validates, and invalidates user sessions
- **Security Middleware**: Validates session tokens on protected routes
- **Email Service**: Sends password reset links and verification emails

### Data Flow
1. User enters registration credentials (email, password)
2. System validates email format and password strength
3. Password is hashed and stored securely
4. User account is created with encrypted password
5. User can log in with email and password
6. System verifies credentials against hashed password
7. Session token is created and returned to client
8. Client includes token in subsequent requests
9. System validates token on each authenticated request
10. User can log out to invalidate session

### API Design
- **POST /api/auth/register**: Creates new user account with email and password
  - Request: { email, password, password_confirm }
  - Response: { success, user_id, message }
- **POST /api/auth/login**: Authenticates user and creates session
  - Request: { email, password }
  - Response: { success, token, user_info, expires_at }
- **POST /api/auth/logout**: Terminates current user session
  - Headers: Authorization: Bearer {token}
  - Response: { success, message }
- **POST /api/auth/password/reset**: Initiates password reset process
  - Request: { email }
  - Response: { success, message }
- **POST /api/auth/password/reset/verify**: Validates reset token and allows password change
  - Request: { token, new_password }
  - Response: { success, message }
- **POST /api/auth/password/update**: Updates password for authenticated user
  - Headers: Authorization: Bearer {token}
  - Request: { current_password, new_password }
  - Response: { success, message }

- **Connection Pooling**: Maintain database connection pool for authentication requests
- **Caching**: Cache active sessions to reduce database load

### Monitoring and Alerting
- **Failed Login Rate**: Alert if exceeds 10% of total logins
- **Account Lockout Frequency**: Alert if excessive legitimate lockouts occur
- **Authentication Error Rate**: Alert if exceeds 1% of requests
- **Session Creation Rate**: Monitor for unusual patterns indicating attacks
- **Password Reset Requests**: Alert if exceeds normal volume (potential attack)

## Risk Assessment

### Security Risks
