## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- OpenAI API Rate Limits: Implement caching and fallback strategies
- Golang Performance: Use profiling tools and optimization techniques
- PostgreSQL Scalability: Implement read replicas and connection pooling
- React/Vite Build Issues: Establish proper build pipeline and testing

### Performance Risks
- Chat Response Delays: Implement response caching and optimized OpenAI calls
- Database Bottlenecks: Use PostgreSQL indexing and query optimization
- Frontend Bundle Size: Leverage Vite's tree-shaking and code splitting
- WebSocket Connection Limits: Implement connection pooling and scaling

## Quality Assurance
