# Task Management: Chat-Based Ecommerce Application

**Project:** Chat-Based Ecommerce Application  
**Technology Stack:** Golang, React/Vite, PostgreSQL, OpenAI GPT-4  
**Generated:** 2024-12-19  
**Total Tasks:** 89

## Constitution Check

All tasks MUST align with constitutional principles:
- **Code Quality:** Tasks must include code review and quality checks
- **Testing Standards:** Testing tasks must be included for all deliverables
- **User Experience Consistency:** UX tasks must follow established design patterns
- **Performance Requirements:** Performance validation must be included where applicable

## User Story Mapping

Based on the specification requirements, the following user stories have been identified:

- **US1 (P1)**: Traditional Web Interface - Users can browse catalog, search products, manage cart, and complete checkout
- **US2 (P1)**: Chat Interface - Users can shop entirely through conversational chat with OpenAI GPT-4
- **US3 (P2)**: Inventory Management - Administrators can manage products, track inventory, and receive alerts
- **US4 (P2)**: Real-time Synchronization - All interfaces share cart state and inventory updates in real-time

## Dependencies

### Story Completion Order
1. **Phase 1**: Setup (Project initialization)
2. **Phase 2**: Foundational (Core infrastructure - blocking prerequisites)
3. **Phase 3**: US1 - Traditional Web Interface (Independent implementation)
4. **Phase 4**: US2 - Chat Interface (Depends on US1 for shared cart state)
5. **Phase 5**: US3 - Inventory Management (Independent implementation)
6. **Phase 6**: US4 - Real-time Synchronization (Depends on US1, US2, US3)
