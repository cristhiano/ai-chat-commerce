# Research Findings: Chat-Based Ecommerce Application

**Date:** 2024-12-19  
**Project:** Chat-Based Ecommerce Application  
**Technology Stack:** Golang, React/Vite, PostgreSQL, OpenAI GPT-4  
**Phase:** Technical Research

## Golang Backend Architecture

### Decision: Gin framework with clean architecture pattern
**Rationale:** Gin provides excellent performance for HTTP APIs, middleware support for authentication and logging, and follows Go best practices. Clean architecture ensures maintainable, testable code with clear separation of concerns.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Echo: Similar performance but less middleware ecosystem
- Fiber: Faster but less mature ecosystem
- Standard net/http: Too low-level for rapid development
- Custom framework: Would require significant development time

## React/Vite Frontend Architecture

### Decision: React with Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
**Rationale:** Vite provides fast development server and optimized builds, TypeScript ensures type safety, and Tailwind CSS enables rapid UI development with consistent design system.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Create React App: Slower build times and less optimization
- Next.js: Overkill for this SPA use case
- Vue.js: Smaller ecosystem compared to React
- Vanilla JavaScript: Would require significant development time

## PostgreSQL Database Design

### Decision: PostgreSQL with GORM ORM and Redis caching
**Rationale:** PostgreSQL provides ACID compliance for transactions, excellent JSON support for flexible product metadata, and strong consistency. GORM simplifies database operations while Redis provides fast caching.

**Alternatives considered:**
- MongoDB: Good for flexible schemas but lacks ACID guarantees
- MySQL: Similar to PostgreSQL but less advanced JSON support
- SQLite: Not suitable for production scalability
- Custom database layer: Would require significant development time

## OpenAI GPT-4 Integration

### Decision: OpenAI GPT-4 API with custom prompt engineering
**Rationale:** GPT-4 provides excellent natural language understanding for ecommerce queries, supports function calling for structured actions, and offers reliable API with good documentation.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Google PaLM: Less mature for ecommerce use cases
- Anthropic Claude: Good alternative but smaller ecosystem
- Local LLM models: Would require significant infrastructure
- Custom NLP: Would require extensive ML expertise

## Real-time Communication

### Decision: WebSocket with Socket.io for bidirectional communication
**Rationale:** WebSocket provides low-latency real-time updates for chat, inventory changes, and cart synchronization. Socket.io adds reliability with fallbacks and room management.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Server-Sent Events: Good for one-way but limited for chat
- Long polling: Higher latency and resource usage
- WebRTC: Overkill for this use case
- Custom WebSocket: Would require significant development time

## Authentication Strategy

### Decision: JWT tokens with refresh token rotation
**Rationale:** Stateless authentication suitable for microservices, supports anonymous shopping with optional authentication, and provides security through token rotation.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Session-based auth: Requires sticky sessions in microservices
- OAuth2: Overkill for this application's needs
- API keys: Not suitable for user authentication
- Custom auth: Would require significant security expertise

## Payment Processing Integration

### Decision: Stripe Payment Intents API
**Rationale:** Provides secure payment processing, supports multiple payment methods, handles PCI compliance, and offers webhook support for order status updates.

**Alternatives considered:**
- PayPal: Good alternative but more complex integration
- Square: Limited international support
- Custom payment gateway: Would require PCI compliance handling
- Cryptocurrency: Not suitable for mainstream ecommerce

## State Management

### Decision: React Context with useReducer for complex state
**Rationale:** Built-in React solution that works well with Vite, provides predictable state updates, and integrates seamlessly with TypeScript.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Redux Toolkit: More complex for this use case
- Zustand: Good alternative but less ecosystem
- MobX: More complex state management
- Custom state management: Would require significant development time

## Testing Strategy

### Decision: Go testing package + Jest/Vitest + Playwright
**Rationale:** Go testing package provides excellent unit testing, Jest/Vitest for React components, and Playwright for end-to-end testing across browsers.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Testify: Good Go testing library but standard package is sufficient
- Cypress: Good E2E alternative but Playwright has better performance
- Custom testing framework: Would require significant development time
- Manual testing only: Not suitable for CI/CD

## Deployment and DevOps

### Decision: Docker containers with Kubernetes orchestration
**Rationale:** Docker ensures consistent environments, Kubernetes provides scaling and high availability, and both are industry standards with excellent tooling.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Serverless: Good for some components but not suitable for WebSocket connections
- VM-based deployment: Less efficient resource utilization
- Custom deployment: Would require significant DevOps expertise
- Monolithic deployment: Would limit scalability

## Performance Optimization

### Decision: Multi-layer optimization strategy
**Rationale:** Go's performance + Vite's optimization + PostgreSQL indexing + Redis caching + CDN provides comprehensive performance optimization.

**Optimization layers:**
- **Backend**: Go's compiled performance, connection pooling, query optimization
- **Frontend**: Vite's tree-shaking, code splitting, asset optimization
- **Database**: PostgreSQL indexing, query optimization, read replicas
- **Caching**: Redis for session data, product data, API responses
- **CDN**: Static assets and product images

## Security Considerations

### Decision: Comprehensive security strategy
**Rationale:** Ecommerce applications require robust security for user data, payment processing, and business operations.

**Security measures:**
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh rotation, secure session management
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control for admin functions
- **Data Protection**: Input validation, SQL injection prevention, XSS protection
- **Payment Security**: Stripe handles PCI compliance, secure webhook validation
- **Infrastructure**: HTTPS everywhere, security headers, vulnerability scanning

## Monitoring and Observability

### Decision: Structured logging with metrics and tracing
**Rationale:** Production ecommerce applications require comprehensive monitoring for performance, errors, and business metrics.

**Monitoring stack:**
- **Logging**: Structured JSON logs with Go's log package
- **Metrics**: Prometheus metrics with Grafana dashboards
- **Tracing**: OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing
- **Alerting**: PagerDuty or similar for critical alerts
- **APM**: Application performance monitoring for bottlenecks
