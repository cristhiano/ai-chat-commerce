## Technical Design

### Architecture Overview
The application follows a microservices architecture with separate services for chat processing, traditional web interface, inventory management, and shared data services. A message queue system ensures real-time synchronization between interfaces.

### Component Design
- **Chat Service**: Handles natural language processing, conversation management, and shopping assistance
- **Web Interface Service**: Manages traditional catalog browsing, search, and checkout functionality
- **Inventory Management Service**: Provides administrative interface for product and stock management
- **Shared Data Service**: Manages product catalog, user accounts, orders, and inventory data
- **Notification Service**: Handles real-time updates and alerts across all interfaces

### Data Flow
1. User interactions flow through respective interface services
2. All services communicate with shared data service for product and user data
3. Inventory changes trigger real-time notifications to all active interfaces
4. Chat service processes natural language and converts to structured shopping actions
5. Order processing flows through unified checkout system regardless of interface origin

### API Design
- **Chat API**: Endpoints for conversation management, product queries, and cart operations
- **Catalog API**: Product search, filtering, and detail retrieval endpoints
- **Inventory API**: Administrative endpoints for product and stock management
- **User API**: Authentication, profile management, and order history endpoints
- **Order API**: Checkout processing and order management endpoints
