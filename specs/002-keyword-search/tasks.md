# Implementation Tasks: Product Keyword Search

**Feature:** Product Keyword Search  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** 2024-12-19  
**Technology Stack:** Golang, React/Vite, PostgreSQL, Redis

## Overview

This document defines the implementation tasks for the Product Keyword Search feature. Tasks are organized by user story phases to enable independent implementation and testing.

## User Stories

### US1: Basic Keyword Search (P1)
**Goal:** Enable users to search products using keywords with basic matching and pagination  
**Test Criteria:** Users can search products and receive paginated results within 1 second

### US2: Advanced Search Features (P2)  
**Goal:** Provide fuzzy matching, relevance ranking, and search filtering  
**Test Criteria:** Search handles typos gracefully and returns relevant results with filters

### US3: Search Optimization (P3)
**Goal:** Implement caching, analytics, and performance optimization  
**Test Criteria:** Search performance meets targets with caching and analytics tracking

## Dependencies

**Story Completion Order:**
- US1 → US2 → US3 (sequential dependencies)
- Each story builds upon the previous one
- Foundational tasks must complete before any user story

## Implementation Strategy

**MVP Scope:** US1 (Basic Keyword Search)  
**Incremental Delivery:** Each user story is independently testable and deployable
